Feature: login to MugFolio
 
  As an avid user of the internet 
  So that I can keep in touch with friends and family
  I want want to login to MugFolio

Scenario: Creating a new account
    Given I am not authenticated
    When I go to register # define this path mapping in features/support/paths.rb, usually as '/users/sign_up'
    And I fill in "user_email" with "<email>"
    And I fill in "user_password" with "<password>"
    And I fill in "user_password_confirmation" with "<password>"
    And I press "Sign up"
    #Then I should see "logged in as <email>" # your work!

    Examples:
      | email           | password   |
      | testing@man.net | secretpass |
      | foo@bar.com     | fr33z3     |
